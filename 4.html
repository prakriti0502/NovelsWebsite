		<td><h1 class="rf">On a stormy winter night, Dr. Ben Payne and writer Ashley Knox are stuck in Salt Lake City airport when their flights home are canceled. Both of them are in hurryâ€”Ben has patients to attend to, and Ashley is getting married the following day. Ben hires a charter plane and offers Ashley a seat, but when their pilot suffers a heart attack during flight, the plane crashes, leaving them stranded in the High Uintas Wilderness.<br><br>

			Though they survive the impact with injuries (Ben has broken ribs and Ashley suffers a terrible leg fracture), they are faced with harsh weather conditions and the fact that no one knows they are missing. The ordeal leads them to rely on each other to stay alive, and ultimately brings them closer.</h1></td></tr>
