			<td><h1 class="fg">When Charles Jacobs, a new minister, comes to town, young Jamie Morton is excited. Almost everyone in the tiny Maine hamlet comes to love Jacobs, his beautiful wife, and his young son. Things change all too suddenly when Mrs. Jacobs and her child die in a gruesome auto accident. Stricken with grief, the reverend denounces God and religion during a sermon, is banished from the town, and spends many years pursuing a career as a sideshow huckster before regaining his belief in God and becoming a prolific faith healer, fuelled by lifelong experiments with electricity. Jamie, meanwhile, grows up to become a musician and begins using heroin, which stops when he meets Jacobs again - Jacobs' unorthodox electrical treatment successfully cures him of his addiction.</h1></td></tr></table>
