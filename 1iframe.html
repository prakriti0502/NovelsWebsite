He was squatting in a chair, with his hands in his trouser-pockets and his head leaning against one of the shelves of the bookcase; near by was an antique wooden chest, covered with vases, china plates and paintings, kept there on view for strangers.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federigo_Tozzi">Federigo Tozzi</a></td>

				<td class="come">CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility's physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered, his chest branded with an ambigram of the word "Illuminati". Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria home and it is ascertained that the Illuminati — an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct — have stolen a canister containing antimatter, a substance with destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN, the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the antimatter's stability but when removed its back-up battery provides power for 24 hours after which the antimatter would fall out of suspension and, on coming into contact with the physical matter of the container, explode. The canister is located somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to an explosion due to occur at midnight, which will wipe out the Vatican.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown">-Dan Brown</a></td>

				<td class="come">One morning, while trying to catch fish for breakfast, Dandelion and Geralt instead haul up an ancient, sealed amphora. Dandelion, in a fit of glee, and ignoring Geralt's explicit warnings, tries to opens the vase. During a struggle between the two the vase falls to the ground and a large cloud of red mist escapes—a genie (or djinn, more accurately). Geralt dives for cover, but Dandelion feels he knows exactly what is happening and held his ground, beginning to recite his list of three wishes. The genie does not fulfill even the first one of the bard's wishes (that his rival die of apoplexy), opting instead to strangle the bard.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Sapkowski">-Andrzej Sapkowski</a></td>
