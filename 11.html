		<h1 class="gfh">Why is it Important to Read NOVELS?</h1>
		<p class="hrg">A new study claims that reading novels makes us nicer and more empathetic, psychologists at the New School for Social Research have found. Emanuele Castano, the study author, said that fiction “forces you as a reader to contribute your own interpretations, to reconstruct the mind of the character.” <br>
Canadian researchers have also found that reading fiction increases our ability to be empathetic to others.<br><br>
<ul>
	<li class="hrg">A 2010 York University study of 4- to 6-year-old children found that greater exposure to children’s literature, but not children’s television programs, correlated with children having a greater sense of empathy. The study authors concluded that “engagement with fictional narratives provides one with information about the social world,” exposing children to worlds outside their own.</li>
	<li class="hrg">A 2006 University of Toronto study found that avid readers of fiction were far more socially adept than avid readers of non-fiction: “Comprehending characters in a narrative fiction appears to parallel the comprehension of peers in the actual world, while the comprehension of expository non-fiction shares no such parallels.” In addition, the researchers concluded that the ability of a reader to become absorbed in a story was related their ability to feel empathy.</li>
</ul><br>
Yet tragically, we’ve seen a decline of the humanities in America. Given how aggressive and violent our culture can be (have you noticed that the new DVD movies are overwhelmingly “action” films, a euphemism for “violence-filled,” often with thousands of deaths per movie, often accompanied by one-liners and other inhumane commentary?), perhaps we should be encouraging more reading, novels in particular.<br></p>
